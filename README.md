# PokeTextures
This plugin allows you to edit Custom Textures ingame without using NBTEditor. Commands are `/ptgive <pokemon> <PlayerName> <Value>` now, for example, the value means the `Custom-ghost` in your texture pack and it would be `/ptgive Lugia runescapejon ghost`. Same goes for the command /pts but it doesn't give anyone the pokemon it just spawns the pokemon the way `/pokespawn` in pixelmon would. If you want more information about Custom-Textures please read the following wiki that the Pixelmon Team has provided for all of us https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Custom_textures
